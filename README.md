# Austins-Sudoku

Java Sudoku by Austin Johnson for personal practice.  Uses SWT, JFrame, and WindowBuilder.

Instructions:
Click "New Puzzle" to start the game. A puzzle will be randomly chosen for you to solve.

Use the radio buttons on the right to either select the number you wish to input or select "Direct Input" to be prompted to type each number.

Click each square you wish to populate with your chosen input.

Once you think the puzzle is solved, click "Check If Solved."  If the puzzle is correctly solved, the puzzle will lock out and tell you that the puzzle is correct.  If the puzzle is still not correctly solved, the puzzle will tell you that it is not yet solved, and you will be able to continue working on it.
